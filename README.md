Windows/VisualStudio users: 

  SKA/MS_VC10/SKA.sln - solution file to build SKA library and to
                        build and run demo apps
  SKA/MS_VC10/cleanup.bat - batch file to remove everything create by SKA.sln

Linux users:

  SKA/makefile: "make" builds SKA library and demo apps
                "make clean" removes everything created by "make"
               
  Executables for the demo applications will be left in the app directory,
  and will have the same name as the app directory.
  For example, the first application will be SKA/apps/app0001/app0001
  
  Linux build has been tested with Ubuntu 12 and CentOS 6.
